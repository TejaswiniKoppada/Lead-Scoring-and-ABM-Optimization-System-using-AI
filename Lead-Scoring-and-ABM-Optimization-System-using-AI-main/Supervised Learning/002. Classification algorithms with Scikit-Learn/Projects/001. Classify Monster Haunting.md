## classification machine learning model with scikit-learn. 

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the class or category of a given input based on its features.

The pipeline diagram shown below illustrates the various steps involved in building a classification model.

Dataset
*Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts dataset*

We will be using the Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts dataset from Kaggle for comparison. The "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!" dataset is a fictional dataset that is often used as a learning resource in machine learning and data science.
