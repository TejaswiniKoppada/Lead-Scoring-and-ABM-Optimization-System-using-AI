***Types of Supervised Learning***

Machine learning is one of the most common applications of Artificial Intelligence. A machine learns to execute tasks from the data fed in it. And with experience, its performance in a given task improves. Machine learning includes supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning techniques.


-Supervised machine learning learns patterns and relationships between input and output data. It is defined by its use of labeled data. A labeled data is a dataset that contains a lot of examples of Features and Target. Supervised learning uses algorithms that learn the relationship of Features and Target from the dataset. This process is referred to as Training or Fitting.

-Unsupervised machine leanring aims to identify inherent patterns, structures, or clusters within the input data itself. Unsupervised learning algorithms work by analyzing the features of the dataset without predefined target values. This allows the algorithm to discover hidden relationships or groupings in the data that might not be immediately apparent. The absence of labels in unsupervised learning makes the task more challenging as the algorithm needs to autonomously find meaningful patterns or representations.

-Reinforced learning is another branch of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions based on interactions with an environment. It involves an agent that takes actions in an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal policy that maximizes its cumulative reward over time.

Types of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning can be further classified into two problems which are:

Classification is a process in which new observations are recognized and separated to categorize them.

Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependable and independent variables.

In both regression and classification, the goal is to find specific relationships or structure in the input data that allow us to effectively produce correct output data.

Note that “correct” output is determined entirely from the training data, so while we do have a ground truth that our model will assume is true, it is not to say that data labels are always correct in real-world situations.
