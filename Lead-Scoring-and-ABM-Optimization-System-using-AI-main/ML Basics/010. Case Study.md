***Case Study***
Objective

The primary goal of this case study is to develop a **machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data and features related to their interactions and usage patterns with the telecom company.**

Predicting churn requires a lot of work and it is not an easy task but, more importantly, it is not even the ultimate goal: it is the starting point to design and implement a customer “retention” strategy!

Dataset

We will use a dataset that includes various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, contract details, and customer service interactions. Additionally, the dataset will have a churn label indicating whether the customer eventually churned or not.

Key questions

In the context of predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning, a data scientist should focus on several key questions to guide the analysis and modeling process effectively:

Problem Formulation and Objectives:

What is the precise problem we are trying to solve? How do we define and measure customer churn in this context?

What are the business objectives related to predicting customer churn, and how will the machine learning model address these objectives?

--Data Understanding:

What does the dataset look like, and what are the attributes or features available for analysis?

What is the quality of the data, and what preprocessing steps are needed to prepare it for machine learning algorithms?

--Feature Selection and Engineering:

What features are relevant for predicting customer churn, and how do we select or engineer them for better predictive performance?

Are there interactions or combinations of features that could enhance the model's predictive power?

--Model Selection:

What machine learning algorithms are suitable for this binary classification problem of predicting churn?

How do we choose the appropriate models based on factors like interpretability, accuracy, and the trade-off between false positives and false negatives?

--Model Evaluation and Validation:

How do we assess the model's performance? Which evaluation metrics are most appropriate for this churn prediction problem?
How can we ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and does not suffer from overfitting or underfitting?
Hyperparameter Tuning:

How do we optimize the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters?

What techniques or strategies are suitable for hyperparameter tuning, and what are the associated computational costs?

--Interpretability and Explainability:

How can we interpret the model's predictions and understand the features that contribute to churn prediction?

What methods can we use to make the model more interpretable and understandable to stakeholders?

By addressing these key questions, a data scientist can systematically approach the customer churn prediction problem, develop a robust machine learning model, and provide valuable insights to aid in business decision-making.

Churn prediction with Machine Learning

Predicting churn is a challenging task due to its subjective nature. The decision to churn is influenced by various factors and might not always follow a logical pattern. Factors such as cost-related concerns or perceived service quality can lead different clients to churn. Moreover, negative experiences with customer service or a negative perception of the product or brand can subjectively drive the decision to churn.

Given these complexities, achieving high model performance in churn prediction is difficult compared to other machine learning tasks. According to Carl S. Gold [1], a reliable churn prediction model is typically expected to attain an AUC score ranging from 0.6 to 0.8, indicating the inherent challenge in accurately predicting churn.
